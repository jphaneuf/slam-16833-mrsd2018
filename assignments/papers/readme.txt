Hi Everyone

After the spring break, we'll be going through some (four) milestone papers in the field of mapping and localization. We would like each student to hand in a very short reading summary (no more than 6 sentences) before these papers are discussed in class. In your short summaries, please address the key contributions and methods used in the paper.

Please hand in your summaries as .txt file submitted to CMU Canvas.
